      <h2 class="border-top">About Corrie</h2>
        <p>I wrote my first lines of code in middle school, and programmed a simple hangman game. I remember being fascinated that some words on my screen could be understood by my computer and I could create things using just the right combination of words. The unfortunate thing was that I was encouraged to study other subjects in school because computer engineering was not considered traditional female work, which my well-meaning parents had implied at that point.</p>

        <p>Fast forward a couple of decades, and I've returned to the fascination that I once discovered as a young girl. As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and hope to encourage other atypical students too!</a>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer, please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
